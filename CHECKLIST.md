## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Can't push to GitHub
**Solution:** Make sure repository is created first at https://github.com/new

### Issue: CI/CD fails
**Solution:** Check Actions tab for detailed logs, usually a test or build issue

### Issue: Kubernetes pods not starting
**Solution:** 
```bash
kubectl describe pod -l app=golang-api -n golang-app
kubectl logs -l app=golang-api -n golang-app
```

### Issue: Port 8080 in use
**Solution:**
```bash
lsof -i :8080
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Issue: Docker image pull fails
**Solution:** Make package public or login:
```bash
docker login ghcr.io -u psyunix
```
