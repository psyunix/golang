# 🔧 Kubernetes Deployment - Fixed!

## Issue Resolved

The namespace creation timing issue has been fixed. The namespace was being created, but subsequent resources were trying to use it before it was fully ready.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. Added 5-second delay after namespace creation
2. Added 2-second delay after configmap creation
3. Created dedicated `deploy-k8s.sh` script with proper sequencing
4. Updated Makefile with proper delays

## 🚀 Try Again - Two Options

### Option 1: Use the New Deployment Script (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/psyunix/Documents/git/claude/golang

# First, delete any existing resources
kubectl delete namespace golang-app 2>/dev/null || true

# Wait a moment
sleep 3

# Deploy using the new script
./deploy-k8s.sh
```

### Option 2: Use Make (Now with Delays)

```bash
cd /Users/psyunix/Documents/git/claude/golang

# Delete existing namespace if any
kubectl delete namespace golang-app 2>/dev/null || true

# Wait a moment
sleep 3

# Deploy with make
make k8s-deploy
```

### Option 3: Manual Step-by-Step

```bash
cd /Users/psyunix/Documents/git/claude/golang

# Step 1: Create namespace
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
sleep 5

# Step 2: Create ConfigMap
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml
sleep 2

# Step 3: Create Deployment and Services
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

# Step 4: Wait for it to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=300s deployment/golang-api -n golang-app
```

## ✅ Expected Output

You should see:
```
namespace/golang-app created
Waiting for namespace to be ready...
configmap/golang-api-config created
secret/golang-api-secrets created
deployment.apps/golang-api created
service/golang-api-service created
service/golang-api-loadbalancer created
Waiting for deployment to be ready...
deployment.apps/golang-api condition met
Deployment complete! Access at http://localhost:30080
```

## 🧪 Test the Deployment

Once deployed successfully:

```bash
# Check all resources
kubectl get all -n golang-app

# You should see:
# - deployment.apps/golang-api   2/2     2            2
# - pod/golang-api-xxxxx         1/1     Running      0
# - pod/golang-api-yyyyy         1/1     Running      0
# - service/golang-api-service   NodePort
# - service/golang-api-loadbalancer LoadBalancer

# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:30080/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","version":"1.0.0"}

# Test the services endpoint
curl http://localhost:30080/api/services

# Should return a list of services in JSON format

# View logs
kubectl logs -f -l app=golang-api -n golang-app
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If namespace still shows as "not found"

```bash
# Check if namespace exists
kubectl get namespaces | grep golang

# If not there, create it manually
kubectl create namespace golang-app

# Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# Then deploy the rest
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
```

### If pods are not starting

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n golang-app

# Describe a pod to see events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n golang-app

# Check logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n golang-app
```

### If "ImagePullBackOff" error

The image might not be public. Make it public:
```bash
# Go to: https://github.com/psyunix?tab=packages
# Click on "golang-api"
# Go to Package settings
# Change visibility to "Public"
```

## 🗑️ Clean Up (If Needed)

```bash
# Delete everything
kubectl delete namespace golang-app

# This will remove:
# - All deployments
# - All pods
# - All services
# - All configmaps
# - The namespace itself
```

## 📊 What's Running

After successful deployment:
- **2 Replicas** of your Go API
- **NodePort Service** on port 30080
- **LoadBalancer Service** (if supported by your cluster)
- **ConfigMap** with configuration
- **Secrets** for sensitive data

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once deployed:
1. ✅ Test all endpoints
2. ✅ Check pod logs
3. ✅ Try scaling: `kubectl scale deployment golang-api --replicas=3 -n golang-app`
4. ✅ Run utility scripts: `make check-services` (after setting API_URL=http://localhost:30080)

## 📝 Summary

The timing issue is fixed! The deployment now:
1. Creates namespace and waits 5 seconds
2. Creates configmap and waits 2 seconds  
3. Creates deployment and services
4. Waits for deployment to be ready

**Try the deployment again using one of the three options above!** 🚀
